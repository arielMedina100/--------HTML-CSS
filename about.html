        <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
            Celebrations
            are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
            of
            lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, but the season actually begins on
            King’s
            Day
            (12th Night), January 6th, and extends until midnight before Ash Wednesday. Club, or Krewe, balls start soon
            after,
            though most are extremely private, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old families and their
            courts
            consisting of the season’s debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not stage parades. As Fat Tuesday
            gets
            nearer,
            the parades start in earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
            have
            several
            large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras
            season. In
            the
            final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
            balls
            (some of
            them masquerade balls).</p>

        <p>In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when former District B
            representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November election, candidate
            Dana Kaplan
            and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote.[13] Cantrell
            served out the
            balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014</p>
