        <h2 class="accordion1">A few questions about Mardi Gras </h2>
        <button class="accordion">Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the
                claims of
                businesses that offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the
                term
                “official”
                is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products
                or
                websites are
                not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of
                its
                merchandise.
                In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is
                not
                true in New
                Orleans.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">When does Mardi Gras start and end?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day
                (Fat
                Tuesday),
                however, is on a different day each year.

                Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday
                is
                always the
                day before Ash Wednesday.

                Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                Wednesday. Check
                out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.</p>

        <button class="accordion">What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change
                from
                one
                extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning
                may
                turn into a
                warm afternoon.

                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat
                dirty. Don’t
                forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a
                raincoat!</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades go by?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that offers a
                balcony, food and
                a bathroom pass.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we call
                it
                the "Greatest
                Free Show on Earth!"</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend
                when Bacchus
                and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans. The
                streets
                are packed all
                day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras)
                and
                Fat Tuesday
                are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night,
                and
                the Zulu
                Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of
                the
                costumes
                and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.</p>
